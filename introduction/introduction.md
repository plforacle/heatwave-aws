# Introduction

MySQL HeatWave on AWS is a fully managed service, developed and supported by the MySQL team at Oracle. Oracle automates tasks such as database and operating system patching. You are responsible for managing your data, schema designs, and access.

With MySQL HeatWave on AWS, you can create and manage a MySQL DB System with a HeatWave Cluster for your AWS applications.

The MySQL Database is built on the MySQL Enterprise Edition Server, which allows developers to quickly create and deploy secure cloud native applications using the world's most popular open source database.

HeatWave is a massively parallel, high performance, in-memory query accelerator that accelerates MySQL performance by orders of magnitude for analytics and mixed workloads. With MySQL HeatWave on AWS, you can provision DB Systems and HeatWave Clusters. When a HeatWave Cluster is enabled, queries that meet certain prerequisites are automatically offloaded from the MySQL DB System to the HeatWave Cluster for accelerated processing.

Below is an example of a MySQL HeatWave on AWS deployment.
